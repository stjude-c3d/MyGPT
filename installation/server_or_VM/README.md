# Installation on Linux server/VM

## Requirements

This readme is an example for a Linux with Ubuntu platform. Only difference between Ubuntu and other platform is how packages are installed, for example, we will be using `apt` in this readme but you can use your own installer like `dnf` or `pacman` as per your Linux platform.

To Run the MyGPT pipeline, we will need the following minimum specifications for your system:

*   8 CPUs
*   8 GB Memory (16 GB or more for better response time)
*   10 GB hard-drive storage

We will also need several tools to run the pipeline:

*   Apt
*   Git
*   Docker
*   Ollama

## Requirements installation

We will install these two tools in the following steps:

1. **Apt installation**

	Check if you have `apt` installed on your system by running following command.

	```
	apt --help
	```

	If you get error that apt not found, you can check what package manager your platform is using as default. Some of the default package managers for Linux system are dnf, yum and pacman. If you have any of these package managers, you might want to edit the commands in the cell below according to your needs. We will be using these package manager to install Git and Docker.

2.  **Apt packages installation**

	We will install Apt packages by running following commands:

	```
	sudo apt install git
	```

3. **Docker installation**

	The MyGPT pipeline will run as a single unit from Docker.
	Check if you have `docker` installed on your system by running following command.

	```
	docker --version
	```

	If you get an error that `docker not found`,   Go to the official Docker installation page for Linux and install the appropriate Docker on your system: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

	You can change Docker setting to match requirements for MyGPT:

4. **Ollama installation**

	Finally, download and install Ollama by following instructions from this offical [Ollama site](https://ollama.ai/)

	After installation, you can run following command in Terminal to start Ollama server, if you haven't done it already:

	```
	sudo systemctl start ollama
	```

	You can check if Ollama is running by visiting http://localhost:11434/ in your default browser.

> [!CAUTION]
> After installing Ollama, close any open Terminal/Command Prompt before you pull Llama2.

Once you start Ollama, you have to pull Lllama2 model by running following command:

```
ollama pull llama2
```

## MyGPT installation

You have 3 options to install MyGPT pipeline:

1. Use pre-built docker images (faster and easier to install, but you can't modify source code)
2. Build docker images from source code (slower, but you can modify source code)
3. Use singularity with pre-built Docker images 

### Option 1: Use pre-built docker images

1. **Get MyGPT source code**

	If you have zip file with MyGPT installation instructions, you can unzip it and copy it on your desktop or your desired location. You can skip remaining instructions from below and go to Step 2.

	Or you can get installation instructions by running following command from Terminal. It will create `MyGPT_public` folder on your Desktop or desired folder. To get this from GitHub, we will need `GitHub username` and `GitHub access token` as the GitHub repo is private. When you run the following command, it will ask for this credentials.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/stjude/MyGPT.git
	```

> [!NOTE] 
> If you don't have GitHub access token, you can genearte classic token using this guideline: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic

> [!CAUTION] 
> While generating you GitHub Access Token, make sure you check access for `repo` and  `read:packages` similar to image below.

<img src="../../images/GitHub_access_token_scope.png?raw=true" width="600px">

2. login to GitHub Docker registry

	As the GitHub repository is private rightnow, we have to login to GitHub Docker registry to use the prebuilt images. To login to GitHub Docker registry, run following command. It will ask for your GitHub username and password. 
	
> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure Docker Desktop application is open and running before running the command.
> the password is your access token (same token you used in step 1), not your github password you use to login in github account.

```
docker login ghcr.io
```

3. **Run docker containers**

	Create and configure the ignored runtime files at the repository root, then run the containers:

	```
	cd MyGPT
	cp .env_backend.example .env_backend
	cp .env_frontend.example .env_frontend
	cd installation/server_or_VM/prebuilt_images_docker
	bash run_docker.sh
	```

	This script should take around 5-10 minutes to run.
	While above script is running, it will open several pages in your default browser. 
	You can see status of different components of MyGPT pipeline on these pages.
	* backend: http://localhost:8000/

	* frontend: http://localhost:3000/

		<img src="../../images/frontend_launch.png?raw=true" width="1200px">


### Option 2: Build docker images from source code

1. **Get MyGPT source code**

	If you have zip file with MyGPT source code, you can unzip it and copy it on your desktop or your desired location. You can skip remaining step from below and go to Step 2.

	If you want to get source code from GitHub we will first get MyGPT source code by running following command. It will create `MyGPT` folder on your Desktop. To get the source code from GitHub, we will need `GitHub username` and `GitHub access token` as the GitHub repo is private. When you run the following command, it will ask for this credentials.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/mb-group/MyGPT.git
	```

	<u>Note:</u> If you don't have GitHub access token, you can genearte classic token using this guideline: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic


2. **Build docker images**

	We will run following script to build docker images:

	```
	cd MyGPT
	bash installation/linux/build_images/build_docker.sh
	```

	Before starting containers, replace all placeholders in `.env_backend` and review the public settings in `.env_frontend`.

4. **Run docker containers**

	We will run following script to run docker containers:

	```
	bash installation/linux/build_images/run_docker.sh
	```

	This script should take around 5-10 minutes to run.
	While above script is running, it will open several pages in your default browser. 
	You can see status of different components of MyGPT pipeline on these pages.
	* backend: http://localhost:8000/

		<img src="../../images/backend_server.png?raw=true" width="500px">

	* frontend: http://localhost:3000/

		<img src="../../images/frontend_launch.png?raw=true" width="1200px">

### Option 3: Use singularity with pre-built Docker images 

1. **Get MyGPT source code**

	If you have zip file with MyGPT source code, you can unzip it and copy it on your desktop or your desired location. You can skip remaining step from below and go to Step 2.

	If you want to get source code from GitHub we will first get MyGPT source code by running following command. It will create `MyGPT` folder on your Desktop. To get the source code from GitHub, we will need `GitHub username` and `GitHub access token` as the GitHub repo is private. When you run the following command, it will ask for this credentials.

2. **Run Docker images**

	[Work in progress]


## MyGPT pipeline usage

### **Upload publications**

* You can upload documents or publications as PDF file by going to the settings, and selecting first tab: "Publication libraries" and selecting "Upload documents" menu as screeshot below.

* start by giving your library a "Library Name" and start uploading documents.

* You can upload upto 40 PDFs at a time. You can upload multiple times to same library. It will take some time to process the documents and once it's done, you can see your new library in the list with success message.
